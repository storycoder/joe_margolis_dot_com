== README

This is my first solo-blog for production. I will create a blog page with the following components.

* Home, About Contact pages where Home is the root element in the routes. 

* A functional blog with commenting capability

* Login User capability via devise

* SASS design elements

In order to pull this off I will need a model where blog_posts have comments and comments belong to blog posts and where users have comments and blog posts and comments and blogposts belong to user.
